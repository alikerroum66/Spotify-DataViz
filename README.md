# Spotify Data Visualization Project

This project analyzes Spotify data to explore trends, artist performance, and audio features of tracks. The goal is to transform complex datasets into clear, actionable insights using Python and Power BI.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze listening behaviors on Spotify
- Explore top artists and tracks
- Correlate streams with audio features (energy, danceability, loudness, valence, etc.)
- Build interactive dashboards for visualization

## Project Structure
- `cleaned/` – cleaned datasets for analysis
- `scripts/` – Python scripts for data processing and visualization
- `spotify_dataset.csv` – raw dataset
- `Dashboars/` – screenshots of dashboards

## Technologies & Skills
- Python, Pandas
- Data Visualization
- Power BI

## Dashboards
